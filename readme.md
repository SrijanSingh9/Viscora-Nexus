# 🌌 Viscora Nexus

> A next-generation, AI-driven web application featuring a multi-persona adaptive interface.

Viscora Nexus is the evolution of the original Viscora project. It is designed to deliver a highly personalized user experience by adapting its interface and capabilities to distinct user personas, such as Students, Homemakers, and Professionals. Built on a robust, decoupled full-stack architecture, it seamlessly integrates natural language processing and advanced database functionalities.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Multi-Persona Adaptive Interface:** The UI/UX dynamically shifts to serve the specific needs and workflows of different user types (Student, Homemaker, Professional).
* **Dual-Access Strategy:** * *General Mode:* Frictionless access to core features without requiring a sign-up.
    * *Major Mode:* A rich, authenticated tier unlocking the full suite of personalized tools and saved preferences.
* **Integrated AI & NLP:** Intelligent chatbots infused with distinct personality traits, capable of contextual understanding and tailored assistance.
* **Local LLM Powered:** Engineered to utilize powerful local language models (like Gemma or Qwen) to ensure privacy, reduce latency, and avoid external API rate limits.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Viscora Nexus leverages a modern, decoupled architecture for maximum scalability and maintainability:

* **Frontend:** Vite (for lightning-fast HMR and optimized builds)
* **Backend:** Django (Python-based, providing a secure and scalable RESTful API)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Robust relational data management for complex user profiles and history)
* **AI Integration:** Local LLMs (Gemma / Qwen), gemini API for deployed (this thing)

## 📐 Architecture


The application separates the frontend presentation layer from the backend business logic. The Vite frontend communicates asynchronously with the Django backend via REST APIs, which in turn manages data persistence in PostgreSQL and orchestrates prompts to the local LLM.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.10+
* Node.js 18+
* PostgreSQL
* (Optional) Ollama or similar local LLM runner for Gemma/Qwen
